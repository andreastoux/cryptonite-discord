# cryptonite-discord
#### A simple Discord bot I made for a Discord server, it converts crypto to fiat and shows cryptocurrency information.

You can test it locally with `npm run dev`. <br/>
In order to make it run, you need to add your own Discord Client ID, Guild ID, Token and Coinmarketcap API Key in an environment variable file.
